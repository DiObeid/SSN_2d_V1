Stabilized Supralinear Network Model of Responses to Surround Stimuli in Primary Visual Cortex. This repository conatins the following codes,
- LT.py : Computes the length tuning curves of selected cells in the network.
- STC_{}.py: These two codes compute the response to a center and a center+surround stimulus at various relative orientations.
- FSS.py: Computes the local population response to a plaid stimulus at the center and a surround stimulus of orientation matching the orienttaion of the second component of the plaid.
- LT_parameter.py, STC_parameter.py and FSS_parameter.py contain the paramters for each of the codes above respectively. The user can merge these files into a single one. We decided to create
  a spearte paramter file for each in-silico experiment since some users may only be inetrested in a specific experiment.
